# AutoFilePath (forked for Sublime Text 4)

## Installation
1. Navigate to `{Sublime AppData}/Packages/User` in the terminal
2. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/andfaulkner/AutoFilePath.git`
    -  Should create directory: `{Sublime AppData}/Packages/User/AutoFilePath`
3. If it doesn't immediately become available, restart Sublime Text.

## Note
- Confirmed working with Sublime Text 4
- Works with LSP and LSP-Typescript active - original AutoFileName caused them to crash
